So here we are. Just as the engine does not run without first turning over, the ship does not sail without her name, and the journey does not begin without boots laced, so the little volume does not grow without quill inked and paper scratched.

Thanks to you, friend, for opening the book. All the adventures to follow shall bear some shadow of your name.
